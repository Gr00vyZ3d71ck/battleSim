Why would you want to write you code in a object-oriented programming language?
OOP offers a structured programming style, it is fast, efficient and easy to execute and helps to keep the code DRY


What's the difference between a class and an object?
A class is used as a blueprint for objects, example: If you have a class called Pokemon, A Pokemon class can have a Name, Strength, Weakness and a experience level
With this blueprint you can create new Pokemon with the required fields in the class.
